# clap plugin interface for zig

[clap](https://github.com/free-audio/clap) is absolutely perfect for integration with Zig, so here it is! :)

This is not a simple translate-c of clap but rather an entire re-implementation in Zig with Zig semantics.

## Build the example

with Zig 0.11.0, compile the `amp` example plugin using

```bash
zig build amp
```
